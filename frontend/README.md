# Forge


Forge is a no-code, unified platform that empowers creators, businesses, and communities to deploy tokens, manage campaigns, and distribute airdrops without requiring blockchain development expertise.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- Integrated airdrop and campaign management system
- Support for specialized tokens (memecoins, stablecoins)
- Web3-native user experience with Web2 simplicity

## 📋 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Web3 Integration**: ethers.js / web3.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
