# SmartX

A decentralized vault platform enabling users to create multiple ERC-4626 compliant vaults for automated yield generation on Base Mainnet.

## Overview

SmartX is a comprehensive DeFi platform that allows users to:

- **Create Multiple Vaults**: Each user can create multiple personal ERC-4626 compliant vaults
- **Automated Yield Generation**: Deploy assets to DeFi protocols (Aave, Compound, Uniswap) automatically
- **ERC-4626 Standard**: Industry-standard tokenized vault interface for maximum interoperability
- **Share-Based Ownership**: Transferable ERC-20 vault shares representing ownership
- **Protocol Allocations**: Configure how assets are distributed across different DeFi protocols

**Note:** Contracts should be audited before mainnet deployment.

## Future Enhancements

### Chainlink Integration Roadmap

SmartX is designed to integrate with Chainlink services for enhanced functionality and automation. The following enhancements are planned for future releases:

#### Phase 1: Price Feeds (In Progress)
**Status:** Planned for next release

- **Chainlink Price Feeds Integration**
  - Real-time USD valuation of vault assets
  - Accurate share pricing in USD terms
  - Multi-asset vault support with proper pricing
  - Portfolio performance tracking

**Implementation:**
- Add Chainlink Price Feed to `UserVault.sol`
- Implement `getTotalValueUSD()` and `getSharePriceUSD()` functions
- Display USD values in frontend dashboard
- Enable better portfolio tracking and analytics

**Files to modify:**
- `contracts/UserVault.sol` - Add price feed integration
- `contracts/VaultFactory.sol` - Store price feed addresses
- Frontend components - Display USD values

---

#### Phase 2: Automation (High Impact)
**Status:** Future consideration

- **Chainlink Automation (formerly Keepers)**
  - Automated vault rebalancing
  - Periodic yield harvesting
  - Protocol switching based on yield
  - Gas-optimized execution

**Implementation:**
- Implement `checkUpkeep()` and `performUpkeep()` in `UserVault.sol`
- Set up rebalancing logic based on protocol yields
- Register vaults with Chainlink Automation network
- Automated yield optimization without manual intervention

**Files to modify:**
- `contracts/UserVault.sol` - Add automation interface and rebalancing logic
- `contracts/VaultFactory.sol` - Automation registry management

**Benefits:**
- Hands-free vault management
- Optimal yield allocation
- Reduced gas costs through batching
- 24/7 monitoring and execution

---

#### Phase 3: VRF (Optional - Gamification)
**Status:** Future consideration

- **Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function)**
  - Lottery/reward system for vault holders
  - Random protocol selection for diversification
  - Fair incentive distribution mechanisms
  - Gamification features

**Implementation:**
- Add lottery/reward system to `VaultFactory.sol`
- Implement VRF for provably fair random selection
- Create incentive mechanisms for long-term holders
- Monthly/quarterly reward distributions

**Files to modify:**
- `contracts/VaultFactory.sol` - Add VRF integration and lottery logic
- Frontend - Lottery participation interface

**Use Cases:**
- Monthly lottery for active vault holders
- Random bonus yield distribution
- Fair protocol allocation
- Community engagement rewards

---

### Additional Planned Features
