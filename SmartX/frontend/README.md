# SmartX — Frontend

A modern Next.js frontend for SmartX - a decentralized vault platform enabling users to create multiple ERC-4626 compliant vaults for automated yield generation. Built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and wagmi for Base Mainnet.

## Overview

SmartX is a comprehensive DeFi platform that allows users to:

- **Create Multiple Vaults**: Each user can create multiple personal ERC-4626 compliant vaults
- **Automated Yield Generation**: Deploy assets to DeFi protocols (Aave, Compound, Uniswap) automatically
- **ERC-4626 Standard**: Industry-standard tokenized vault interface for maximum interoperability
- **Share-Based Ownership**: Transferable ERC-20 vault shares representing ownership
- **Protocol Allocations**: Configure how assets are distributed across different DeFi protocols

### Multi-Vault Management

- **Create multiple personal vaults** for different strategies or assets
- **ERC-4626 compliant vaults** with standardized interface
- **Track all vaults** in a unified dashboard
- **Manage vault configurations** individually

### Vault Operations

- **Deposit assets** into vaults and receive share tokens
- **Withdraw assets** by redeeming vault shares
- **Transfer vault shares** as ERC-20 tokens
- **Configure protocol allocations** (Aave, Compound, Uniswap)

### Automated Yield Generation

- **Multi-protocol deployment** to DeFi protocols
- **Strategy configuration** for each vault
- **Real-time performance tracking**
- **Yield harvesting** and compounding

Built for Ethereum-compatible chains, with primary deployment on Base Mainnet.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Web3:** wagmi, viem, Reown AppKit (WalletConnect)
- **State Management:** React Hooks

## Design System

### Color Scheme

The SmartX frontend uses a sophisticated color palette featuring:
- **Primary Colors:** Shades of red for primary actions and branding
- **Neutral Colors:** Black, grey, and white for backgrounds, text, and UI elements
- **Accent Colors:** Red variations for highlights and interactive elements

This color scheme creates a modern, professional, and visually appealing interface that reflects the platform's DeFi focus.
